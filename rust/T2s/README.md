# t2s — TCP to SOCKS5 helper/router

`t2s` is a Rust helper bundled with ZDT-D. It receives TCP connections from a
local listener and forwards them through one or more upstream SOCKS5 backends, or
optionally directly when policy allows it. Root deployments can use transparent
redirection; non-root deployments can use the authenticated SOCKS5 listener.

In ZDT-D, `t2s` is the common bridge between UID-based `iptables` transparent
redirection and proxy engines that expose SOCKS5-compatible local ports.

## What t2s does

`t2s` can:

- listen on an internal TCP port;
- optionally expose an external listener;
- recover the original destination with Linux `SO_ORIGINAL_DST` in transparent mode;
- forward TCP streams to SOCKS5 upstreams;
- use multiple SOCKS5 backends;
- select backends by balance or priority policy;
- monitor backend health;
- fall back to direct connections when policy allows it;
- expose a local web UI/API for status and runtime management;
- keep a connection registry and kill active connections;
- apply download throttling;
- evaluate traffic rules from `TRAFFIC_RULES`;
- sniff HTTP Host, HTTP CONNECT target and TLS SNI on a best-effort basis.

TCP proxying is always available. When ZDT-D enables `tproxy_enabled`, t2s also
starts a UDP TPROXY relay. DNS resolution/routing policy remains external to t2s.

## Where ZDT-D uses it

`t2s` is used by several local proxy pipeline integrations, including:

- sing-box proxy scenarios;
- wireproxy profiles;
- Tor SOCKS pipelines;
- opera-proxy pipelines;
- myproxy profiles;
- selected myprogram scenarios that expose a SOCKS5 endpoint.

Typical ZDT-D routing chain:

```text
selected app UID -> iptables REDIRECT -> t2s listener -> SOCKS5 backend -> upstream network
```

## Modes

### Non-root SOCKS router mode

`--non-root` is intended for the Android app-owned `VpnService -> tun2socks ->
t2s` pipeline. It deliberately does not emulate transparent/root routing. The
internal listener becomes a strict SOCKS5 CONNECT/UDP ASSOCIATE endpoint and requires
RFC1929 username/password authentication.

In this mode:

- `TPROXY`, `IP_TRANSPARENT`, `SO_ORIGINAL_DST` and UDP TPROXY are disabled;
- `/data/adb/modules/ZDT-D` settings and token paths are never read;
- `protector_mode` root settings are ignored;
- the listener and web/API bind addresses must be loopback addresses;
- `--external-port` and fixed `--target-host/--target-port` are rejected;
- `--api-dir` must point to app-owned storage;
- the token is required and defaults to `<api-dir>/token`;
- API and WebSocket access require the same token even on loopback;
- inbound SOCKS5 authentication uses username `zdtd` and the app token as the
  password;
- inbound UDP ASSOCIATE is enabled by default for the app-owned VpnService path;
  the UDP relay is bound to loopback and lives only for the authenticated control connection.

Example app-owned layout:

```text
<filesDir>/nonroot/
  api/
    token
    t2s/
      info.json
      instances/
      ports/
      locks/
```

Example startup:

```bash
t2s \
  --non-root \
  --api-dir /data/user/0/com.android.zdtd.service/files/nonroot/api \
  --listen-addr 127.0.0.1 \
  --listen-port 11290 \
  --socks-host 127.0.0.1 \
  --socks-port 1080,1081 \
  --backend-mode balance \
  --web-socket \
  --web-addr 127.0.0.1 \
  --web-port 8000
```

The upstream tun2socks client must connect to `127.0.0.1:11290` with:

```text
username = zdtd
password = <contents of <api-dir>/token>
```

The Android application should pass its real private `filesDir` path rather
than relying on the example package path above, because Android user/profile
IDs can change the absolute path.

### Transparent mode

When `--target-host` and `--target-port` are omitted, `t2s` expects traffic that
was redirected by firewall rules. It calls `SO_ORIGINAL_DST` to recover the
original destination address and port.

Example:

```bash
t2s \
  --listen-addr 127.0.0.1 \
  --listen-port 11290 \
  --socks-host 127.0.0.1 \
  --socks-port 1080
```

Example redirect rule:

```bash
iptables -t nat -A OUTPUT -p tcp -j REDIRECT --to-ports 11290
```

### Explicit target mode

When `--target-host` and `--target-port` are provided together, every incoming
connection is forwarded to the fixed target.

```bash
t2s \
  --listen-addr 127.0.0.1 \
  --listen-port 11290 \
  --socks-host 127.0.0.1 \
  --socks-port 1080 \
  --target-host example.com \
  --target-port 443
```

Both target options must be used together. Supplying only one is an error.

## Command-line arguments

### Listeners

- `--listen-addr <ADDR>` — internal listener address. Default: `127.0.0.1`.
- `--listen-port <PORT>` — internal listener port. Default: `11290`.
- `--external-port <PORT>` — optional external listener on `0.0.0.0:<PORT>`.
  `0` disables it. Default: `0`.

### SOCKS5 upstreams

- `--socks-host <HOST[,HOST...]>` — comma-separated SOCKS5 host list. Required
  when `--socks-port` contains real SOCKS5 backend ports. It can be omitted only
  for priority direct-only mode (`--backend-mode priority --socks-port 0`).
- `--socks-port <PORT[,PORT...]>` — required comma-separated SOCKS5 port list.
  In priority mode, a single `0` marker is also supported at the beginning or at
  the end of the list; see Priority mode below.
- `--socks-user <USER>` — optional global SOCKS5 username.
- `--socks-pass <PASS>` — optional global SOCKS5 password.

Startup backends are built from all configured hosts and ports. For example:

```bash
--socks-host 10.0.0.1,10.0.0.2 --socks-port 1080,1081
```

creates combinations for those hosts and ports. Runtime API-added backends can
provide their own username/password override.

### Backend mode

- `--backend-mode balance|priority` — default: `balance`.
- `--backend-priority <GROUPS>` — priority groups for priority mode.
- `--priority-speed-aware` — optional soft fallback for throughput-limited
  priority backends.

#### Balance mode

All GREEN backends participate in balancing. If a backend becomes unhealthy,
connections pinned to it are cancelled so clients can reconnect through another
healthy backend or direct fallback.

#### Priority mode

Backends are grouped by priority. Commas separate backends in the same group;
semicolons separate fallback levels:

```text
1145,1146;1147
```

This means:

1. use 1145 and 1146 as the first priority group;
2. use 1147 only when the first group has no GREEN backend;
3. fall back to direct only when no configured backend is available and policy
   allows direct fallback.

If `--backend-priority` is omitted, the order of `--socks-port` becomes the
priority order. Example:

```text
--socks-port 1145,1146,1147
```

behaves like:

```text
--backend-priority "1145;1146;1147"
```

In priority mode, the ZDT-D `protector_mode` forced-GREEN behavior is ignored so
failed priority backends do not remain artificially selectable.

#### Priority direct marker `0`

Priority mode supports a special `0` marker in `--socks-port`. It is not a real
SOCKS5 port and no backend is created for it. The marker is valid only with
`--backend-mode priority`, may appear only once, and must be either the first or
the last item in the comma-separated port list.

Supported forms:

- `--socks-port 0` — direct-only mode. `t2s` runs without SOCKS backends and
  sends traffic directly. If direct access fails, the connection fails.
- `--socks-port 0,1145,1146` — direct-first priority. `t2s` tries direct access
  first. If direct access fails, it temporarily cools down direct attempts and
  uses the normal SOCKS priority chain (`1145` then `1146`).
- `--socks-port 1145,1146,0` — SOCKS-only priority with blocked direct fallback.
  `t2s` uses the normal SOCKS priority chain. If all configured SOCKS backends
  are dead, direct fallback is blocked and traffic does not leave until a backend
  becomes GREEN again.

Examples:

```bash
# Prefer direct Internet, then fall back to local SOCKS backends.
t2s --backend-mode priority --socks-host 127.0.0.1 --socks-port 0,1145,1146

# Use one SOCKS backend; if it is dead, block traffic instead of leaking direct.
t2s --backend-mode priority --socks-host 127.0.0.1 --socks-port 1145,0

# Direct-only mode, no SOCKS host is required.
t2s --backend-mode priority --socks-port 0
```

Invalid forms include `1145,0,1146`, `0,1145,0`, and any use of `0` outside
priority mode.

#### Priority speed-aware mode

`--priority-speed-aware` keeps strict priority as the default but allows a soft
fallback when real traffic shows that a higher-priority GREEN backend is
throughput-limited. The helper probes a lower GREEN backend with a new real
connection and temporarily sends new connections there if it is clearly faster.
Existing connections are not killed for this speed shift. Later probes can return
new traffic to the higher-priority backend after recovery.

### Target selection

- `--target-host <HOST>` — fixed upstream target host.
- `--target-port <PORT>` — fixed upstream target port.

Both must be used together. If both are omitted, transparent mode is used.

### Runtime and limits

- `--buffer-size <BYTES>` — socket buffer size. Default: `65536`.
- `--idle-timeout <SECONDS>` — idle timeout. `0` disables it. Default: `600`.
- `--connect-timeout <SECONDS>` — backend connect timeout. Default: `8`.
- `--enable-http2` — compatibility flag retained for parity; currently no-op.
- `--max-conns <COUNT>` — maximum concurrent connections. Default: `100`.
- `--download-limit-mbit <MBIT>` — download throttling in Mbit/s. `0` disables
  throttling. Default: `0`.

### Runtime ownership and authentication

- `--non-root` — enable app-owned strict SOCKS5 router mode described above.
- `--api-dir <DIR>` — root API directory. Root default:
  `/data/adb/modules/ZDT-D/api`. With `--non-root`, an app-owned directory must
  be supplied explicitly; t2s metadata is stored below `<api-dir>/t2s`.
- `--token-file <FILE>` — override the API/SOCKS authentication token file.
  Root default: `/data/adb/modules/ZDT-D/api/token`. Non-root default:
  `<api-dir>/token`.

The non-root token must exist before t2s starts, be non-empty, and be at most
255 UTF-8 bytes because the same value is used as the RFC1929 SOCKS5 password.
Missing/invalid token or an unwritable app runtime directory is a startup error
in non-root mode.

### Web UI/API

- `--web-socket` — enable web UI/API server.
- `--web-addr <ADDR>` — web bind address. Default: `127.0.0.1`.
- `--web-port <PORT>` — web bind port. Default: `8000`.

The web server starts only when `--web-socket` is enabled.

## Web endpoints

When enabled:

- `GET /` — embedded single-page web UI;
- `GET /ws` — websocket state stream;
- `GET /api/version` — version/build information;
- `GET /api/state` — current runtime snapshot;
- `POST /api/download_limit` — update download throttling;
- `POST /api/backends/add` — add SOCKS backend at runtime;
- `POST /api/backends/remove` — remove SOCKS backend at runtime;
- `GET /api/kill?cid=<id>` — kill a connection by ID;
- `POST /api/kill` — kill a connection by JSON payload.

Example payloads:

```json
{"mbit": 25}
```

```json
{"host": "127.0.0.1", "port": 1080}
```

```json
{"host": "127.0.0.1", "port": 1080, "username": "user", "password": "pass"}
```

```json
{"cid": "12345"}
```

Rules for API-added backend credentials:

- `username` and `password` must be provided together;
- empty strings are treated as missing;
- duplicate detection is by resolved `host:port`;
- to change credentials for an existing backend, remove it and add it again;
- when no per-backend credentials are provided, the global CLI SOCKS auth is used
  if present.

## Traffic rules

`t2s` can load rules from the `TRAFFIC_RULES` environment variable. The value can
be either a JSON array or an object with a `rules` array.

Supported actions:

- `socks` — force SOCKS backend forwarding;
- `direct` — connect directly;
- `drop` — terminate;
- `reset` — accepted by the parser and implemented as early termination;
- `wait` — wait for backend availability/policy conditions.

Supported match fields:

- `proto`;
- `port`;
- `port_range` such as `1000-2000`;
- `host_regex`;
- `socks_available`;
- `is_udp`.

Example:

```json
{
  "rules": [
    {"when": {"host_regex": "(^|\\.)example\\.com$"}, "action": "direct"},
    {"when": {"port": 443, "socks_available": true}, "action": "socks"}
  ]
}
```

Host rules depend on best-effort metadata sniffing. `t2s` can inspect HTTP Host,
HTTP CONNECT and TLS SNI. Under load, sniffing uses a smaller budget or can be
skipped when no host-based rule requires it.

## Health checks and direct fallback

Backends are monitored and classified by runtime health. GREEN backends are
eligible for SOCKS forwarding. When no eligible SOCKS backend is available,
`t2s` can use direct fallback if current rules and policy allow it.

Priority `0` marker modes adjust this behavior: a leading `0` tries direct first,
a trailing `0` blocks direct fallback when all SOCKS backends are unavailable,
and a single `0` runs direct-only without SOCKS backends.

Direct fallback is not treated as a permanent bypass. When healthy backends
recover, direct connections can be terminated so clients reconnect through the
proxy path.

## Connection registry

Each active connection is tracked with metadata such as connection ID, target,
backend, state and traffic counters. The web UI/API uses this registry to display
runtime state and kill selected connections.

## Multiple t2s instances sharing one backend

Several ZDT-D profiles can run their own t2s instance while all of them forward
to the same local SOCKS5 proxy. Some such proxies cannot accept two clients at
the same moment: two overlapping TCP+SOCKS handshakes break the requests. t2s
instances now coordinate through the metadata they already publish under
`<api-dir>/t2s`:

### Shared backend health

Instances whose backend sets intersect form a coordination group (discovered
via `instances/*.json` and each peer's authenticated `/api/v1/backends`). The
group leader is deterministic — the lowest `instance_id` — and keeps running
its normal health loop. Followers suspend their own backend probing and import
the leader's backend snapshot every scan (10s when peers are active, 30s when
quiet), so all instances agree on GREEN/YELLOW/RED and a fragile proxy is
probed by one instance instead of N. Observations newer than the imported ones
(such as a follower's own runtime suspect recheck) always win. If the leader
disappears, followers resume their own probing automatically; a solo instance
behaves exactly as before.

### Serialized backend handshakes

Every dial to a backend (client CONNECT, health probe, wrapped-remote
handshake, UDP ASSOCIATE) takes a per-backend cross-process `flock` on
`<api-dir>/t2s/locks/backend-<ip>-<port>.lock` for the duration of the TCP
connect + SOCKS handshake, then optionally holds it for
`--connect-stagger-ms` (default 100) after success. Concurrent handshakes to
the same backend — from peers or from a burst inside one instance — therefore
never overlap, while established relays and different backends stay fully
parallel. The lock is released by the kernel if a process dies, and every
coordination failure fails open (dials proceed unsynchronized) so coordination
can never cause an outage.

### Accelerated recovery after network changes

A network switch (Wi-Fi <-> mobile) can leave most of a 10-backend pool
suddenly dead while the states are still stale-GREEN: the no-GREEN recovery
ladder does not trigger, and the normal health cadence under traffic is
45-60s, which is why a full API-poked recheck used to be needed. t2s now
detects the switch deterministically and reacts in seconds:

- **Egress-IP detection**: the kernel-chosen source IP for outbound traffic is
  sampled with a UDP `connect` (no packet is sent) on every accepted
  connection and on every health-loop pass. A changed IP - or the route
  disappearing and reappearing - is an unambiguous network change, even when
  local proxy engines keep answering and no failure signature would assemble.
- **Mass-failure signature**: at least 3 distinct backends reporting failures
  of ANY class within 15s starts the same sweep (dead upstreams trickle
  failures slowly, so the window matches real timings).
- **Accelerated parallel sweep**: on either signal one immediate full sweep
  runs (throttled to once per 10s), full-probing every backend in parallel
  with a concurrency cap of 3 - different backends hold different dial locks,
  so a fragile proxy still never sees two simultaneous handshakes, but 10
  backends cost ~3-4 probe rounds instead of 10 sequential ones. The total
  probe volume per event is one sweep, so rare network changes add no
  background energy; idle cadences are unchanged.
- **Internet re-verification for non-GREEN backends**: Light probes only prove
  the local engine is alive. A Yellow backend whose upstream recovered is now
  re-verified with a full Internet probe as soon as the probe backoff allows
  (30s -> 900s escalation), instead of waiting for the 15-minute full-probe
  cycle that used to leave it unusable for many minutes.

Coordination followers first delegate the sweep to the health leader
(`POST /api/v1/backends/recheck`) and import its snapshot; if the leader does
not confirm working backends, the follower fails open and sweeps locally -
cross-process dial locks make concurrent probing safe, only the double-probe
energy saving is lost.

Flags: `--no-peer-coordination`, `--no-serialize-backend-connects`,
`--connect-stagger-ms <MS>`. Coordination assumes instances sharing a backend
also share its credentials; when the shared API token file is missing, peer
health sharing is disabled and each instance keeps probing independently.

In non-root mode the same coordination data lives entirely under the app-owned
`<api-dir>/t2s` directory and uses the app token. No `/data/local/tmp` fallback
is used.

## Limitations

- TCP proxying is always available;
- root transparent UDP relay is enabled only by ZDT-D `tproxy_enabled`; non-root UDP ASSOCIATE is enabled by default;
- non-root mode accepts authenticated SOCKS5 CONNECT and UDP ASSOCIATE on the app-owned loopback listener;
- no internal DNS server;
- `--enable-http2` is a compatibility flag, not a separate HTTP/2 engine;
- host detection is best-effort and depends on early traffic bytes;
- transparent mode depends on Linux/Android firewall behavior and
  `SO_ORIGINAL_DST` availability.

## Build

```bash
cargo build --release -p t2s
```


## TPROXY transparent mode

When `/data/adb/modules/ZDT-D/setting/setting.json` has `"tproxy_enabled": true`, t2s opens TCP as a transparent listener and starts a UDP TPROXY receiver on the same numeric listen port. No CLI arguments are added. Firewall, mark and policy-routing rules are managed outside t2s. When `tproxy_enabled` is false, UDP is not started.

UDP routing: balance mode uses a GREEN backend with SOCKS5 UDP ASSOCIATE support, otherwise direct. Priority mode first finds the first GREEN priority group; UDP may use only UDP-capable backends in that group, otherwise direct.
